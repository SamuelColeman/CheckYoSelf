## Motivation

Check Yo' Self is the final solo project I was assigned as a mod one student at Turing. I was given a page comp with certiain requirements to reproduce from scratch in code. This was completed by primarily working with JavaScript functionality and using HTML and CSS for the foundation and styling on the page.


## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Blood, sweat, and tears
